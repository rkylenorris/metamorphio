## Summary

Life tracker app made to emulate RPG features as a means of gamification where leveling up, achievements, streaks, and more serve as a reward mechanism to increase engagement, helping users remember to update the tracker regularly & further reinforce habits, etc.

This app is focused on actions, things you do, not internal state or mood as I already have a solution for those; and this RPG style gamification is more in line with actions instead of mood.
